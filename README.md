## Front-end Installation

💿 Clone the repo and install all dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Pedrojok01/MoveMyNFT.git
cd movemynft-App
yarn install
```

✏ Edit the `.env.example` file in the main folder with all required info. Don't forget to remove `.example` !
Example:

```jsx
NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_ENV = development;
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY = api_key_here;
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL = "http://localhost:3000/";
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID = api_key_here;
MORALIS_API_KEY = api_key_here;
ALCHEMY_API_KEY = api_key_here;
```

🔎 Locate the file constant.js in `src/data/constant.ts` and paste your smart-contracts addresses;

```jsx
// Production:
export const MOVE_MY_NFT_ETHEREUM = "";
export const MOVE_MY_NFT_BSC = "";
export const MOVE_MY_NFT_POLYGON = "";

// Development:
export const MOVE_MY_NFT_GOERLI = "";
export const MOVE_MY_NFT_MUMBAI = "";
export const MOVE_MY_NFT_BSC_TESTNET = "";
```

🔎 Locate the ABIs files in the `src/data/abis` folder and edit your ABIs if you've made any changes to the smart-contracts;

```jsx
export const NFT_ABI = ["NFT ABI here...];
```
